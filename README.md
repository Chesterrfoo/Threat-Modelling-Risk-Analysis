Prime Technologies Sdn. Bhd. – Security Controls Demonstration

This repository contains three security demonstrations developed for a cybersecurity project focusing on the risks and defenses of an IoT/Smart Device company. The purpose of these demos is to show practical implementations of security controls that mitigate real threats identified during threat modelling and detailed risk assessment.

Prime Technologies Sdn. Bhd. (fictional) develops cloud-connected IoT devices such as smart locks, sensors, and lighting systems. These demos illustrate how the organization can strengthen its cybersecurity posture using modern, industry-standard security practices.

📌 Project Overview

Through the STRIDE threat modelling framework and detailed risk analysis, the following high-risk issues were identified:

Weak authentication → Credential theft

API exposure → Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks

Insecure firmware update mechanism → Firmware tampering

Lack of authenticity checks → Supply-chain attacks

This repository demonstrates three security controls designed to address these issues:

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

API Rate Limiting (DoS Mitigation)

Firmware Integrity & Digital Signature Verification (GUI)

Each control is implemented with working Python scripts that you can run and test directly.

🚀 Demonstrations Included
1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Demo

Folder: mfa_demo/

This demo simulates a secure login system that requires:

A correct password

A valid 6-digit TOTP code generated by an Authenticator app

A QR code (popup window) to register the MFA account

Compatible with:

Microsoft Authenticator

Google Authenticator

Authy

🔐 Purpose

To prevent unauthorized access even if an attacker gains the password.

🛠 Tools Used

Python

pyotp (TOTP generation)

qrcode + Pillow (QR code popup)

Any authenticator app (Microsoft Authenticator recommended)

📂 Files

mfa_demo.py — Full MFA simulation with QR popup

2. API Rate Limiting Demo

Folder: api_rate_limit_demo/

A Flask-based REST API demonstrating:

✔ Normal API access
✔ Automatic blocking after too many requests
✔ HTTP 429 “Too Many Requests”
✔ Realistic DoS mitigation
✔ Optional attacker script

⚡ Purpose

To protect cloud APIs from:

Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks

Brute-force attempts

Request flooding

🛠 Tools Used

Python

Flask

Flask-Limiter

Optional: Postman or Python attacker script

📂 Files

api_rate_limit_demo.py — API endpoint with rate limiting

attack_script.py — Simulated DoS attacker (optional)

3. Firmware Integrity & Digital Signature Verification (GUI Version)

Folder: firmware_security_demo/

This advanced demo simulates modern IoT firmware security using:

✔ SHA-256 hashing (Integrity Check)

Detects ANY modification in firmware.

✔ RSA Digital Signatures (Authenticity Check)

Ensures firmware was created by Prime Technologies and not tampered with.

✔ Tkinter GUI

User-friendly visual interface for

Selecting firmware files

Selecting signature file

Selecting public key

Verifying authenticity and integrity

🛠 Tools Used

Python

cryptography library (RSA-PSS + SHA-256)

hashlib (SHA-256 hashing)

Tkinter (built-in GUI)

📂 Files

gen_keys.py — Generates RSA private/public keys

sign_firmware.py — Generates .sig signature from original firmware

firmware_gui_verify.py — GUI application for firmware verification

Firmware files:

firmware_original.bin

firmware_modified.bin

firmware_original.bin.sig

📦 Installation

Install all required dependencies:

pip install flask flask-limiter pyotp qrcode[pil] cryptography pillow


Tkinter is included with Python, no separate installation needed.

▶️ Running the Demos
Run MFA Demo
python mfa_demo/mfa_demo.py


Follow prompts:

Scan QR

Enter password

Enter TOTP code

Run API Rate Limiting Demo

Start API:

python api_rate_limit_demo/api_rate_limit_demo.py


Access in browser:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/


Refresh repeatedly to trigger rate limiting.

Optional attacker:

python api_rate_limit_demo/attack_script.py

Run Firmware Integrity & Signature Demo
1. Generate RSA keys
python firmware_security_demo/gen_keys.py

2. Sign original firmware
python firmware_security_demo/sign_firmware.py -i firmware_original.bin

3. Launch GUI app
python firmware_security_demo/firmware_gui_verify.py


Use GUI to:

Compare hashes

Verify RSA signature

Detect tampered firmware

🔒 Security Context

These demonstrations represent realistic IoT security measures:

MFA protects authentication

Rate limiting protects cloud services

Digital signatures protect device firmware integrity

Together, they form a layered defense strategy aligned with modern cybersecurity best practices.
